### Problems Faced During the Project 


1. The First Problem which arised during the process was using RxJava or Coroutines for the API Call . Since i am Familiar with Both , I went with CoRoutines because of the less code to be written using Coroutines 
2. The Second Problem !.What should i be using the Architecture Pattern for the Application.So i have worked with MVVM Architecture which also i think is the best Pattern for an Android Application.
3. The Third Problem was the API . Many Modules were covered through the Free API i.e. Current Weather API and & 7 Day Forecase .But the API was not able to solve the problem in the Date MODULE .Fetching Date for a specific date was Problem
4. The Problem faced was the UI. I am not so good with UI .But i maintained the Application with Material Design Guidelines and Card views are used give more Materialistic Design.
