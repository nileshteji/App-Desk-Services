### Problems Faced During the Project 


1. The First Problem which arised during the process was using RxJava or Coroutines for the API Call . Since i am Familiar with Both , Coroutines was chosen over rxjava because it was more simpler to code 
2. The Second Problem was to choose the Architecture Pattern for the Application. As i had hands on with MVVM Architecture i choose to go with it as it is best pattern for the android application
3. The Third Problem was the API . Many Modules were covered through the Free API i.e. Current Weather API and & 7 Day Forecast .But the API was not able to solve the problem in the Date MODULE .Fetching Date for a specific date was Problem
4. The Problem faced was the UI. I am not so good with UI .But i maintained the Application with Material Design Guidelines and Card views are used give more Materialistic Design.
